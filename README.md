# Kobrd

*Kobrd* (a mashup of the words "Korean" and "keyboard") was made as part of CS50's web track and as a landing page for the typing app I made for the classe's final project.

I've been learning Korean on and off since High School and always struggled to type in Korean on a computer keyboard. Although the app is far -eons- from being perfect, my typing speed has already become a little bit faster.


### The App features :
** 12 Levels to fully learn how to type on a Korean keyboard
** Highlighting of correct and wrong input
** Progress bar
** WPM rate
** Motivational quotes generated randomly at the start of each level
** Virtual keyboard to act as visual aid
** Game Mode : generates random 10-word sentences based on 1000 most used Korean words
** Dark Mode (based on browser preferences)
